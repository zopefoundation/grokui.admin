grokui.admin changes
********************

0.6 (unreleased)
================

0.5 (2009-09-15)
================

Feature changes

  of dependencies.

0.4 (2009-08-21)
================

Feature changes
---------------

* Added a security notifier to inform users when security issues are
  published on http://grok.zope.org. The notifier must be explicitly
  enabled. You can also run your own site/directory to place security
  notifications.

* Added info views to get important information easier with tools like
  ``curl``. Supported infos:

    - Grok version used

    - Current security notification (if any).

Bug fixes
---------

* Adapting this package to use the new version of grokcore.view 
  which splits View into CodeView.

  problem with zope.container versions.

* Include the new grok.View permissions for testing.
