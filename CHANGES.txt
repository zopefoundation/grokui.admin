grokui.admin changes
********************

0.4 (unreleased)
================

Feature changes
---------------

* Added a security notifier to inform users when security issues are
  published on http://grok.zope.org. The notifier must be explicitly
  enabled. You can also run your own site/directory to place security
  notifications.

* Added info views to get important information easier with tools like
  ``curl``. Supported infos:

    - Grok version used

    - Current security notification (if any).

* Added dependency for zope.app.preference. This is needed by
  zope.app.apidoc but not alway fetched.
