The admin-UI now supports detection and deletion of broken objects. It
is still limited to IApplication objects in the root folder. Options
to repair broken objects are also still missing.

We first setup the environment:

  >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
  >>> browser = Browser()
  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic mgr:mgrpw')

If no broken applications are in the root, everything should look as
usual:

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/applications')
  >>> 'Broken applications:' not in browser.contents
  True

Now we grok this module, to have a new application type available,
which is intentionally broken:

  >>> browser.open('http://localhost/applications')
  >>> 'PseudoBroken' in browser.contents
  True

We add an instance of that new type:

  >>> subform = browser.getForm(name='PseudoBroken')
  >>> subform
  <zope.testbrowser.browser.Form object at 0x...>

  >>> subform.getControl('Name your new app').value = 'mybrokenobj'
  >>> subform.getControl('Create').click()

and the broken object should show up in the applications list:

 >>> print browser.contents
 <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
 ...
 ...Currently no working applications are...installed...
 ...
 ...Broken applications:...
 ...
 ...(broken type: grokui.admin.tests.brokenobjs.PseudoBroken)...
 ...This application is broken!...
 ...

If we want to delete the broken object, we can do so:

  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name='items')
  >>> ctrl.getControl(value='mybrokenobj').selected = True
  >>> browser.getControl('Delete Selected').click()
  >>> print browser.contents
  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  ...
  ...Application `mybrokenobj` was successfully deleted.
  ...

and the 'Broken applications' section won't show up anymore:

  >>> 'Broken applications:' not in browser.contents
  True
